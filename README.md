###### ***Tip/ reminder:*** Please keep in mind that the 2nd child of the Player gameObject called: "ItemSpawnSpot"'s scale is proportionally adjusted to the player size. The Player's default scale is 2 and so the ItemSpawnSpot's is 0.5. This is done so the items in the hand of the player don't change scale/ size, when spawned in the hand of the player.
