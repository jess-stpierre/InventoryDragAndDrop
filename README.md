This is a standalone inventory system with an editor tool called: InventoryDragDropEditorTool.
This tool allows for easy item creation and editing.
The instructions on how to use the InventoryDragDropEditorTool are at this link below:

Here is a screenshot of the tool. I am no artist so I apologize for it's look.

Please keep in mind that 2nd child of the Player gameObject called: "ItemSpawnSpot"'s scale is proportionally adjusted to the player size. The Player's default scale is 2 and so the ItemSpawnSpot's is 0.5. This is done so the items in the hand of the player don't change scale/ size, when spawned in the hand of the player.
